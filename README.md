Two different exercises here. One(PyBank) analyzing a financial readout of profit and losses by month, the other (PyPoll) tallying up votes from an election and determining the winner.

## PyBank
Here we're determining the total amount of months in the financial readout, the total dollars we have at the end of the time period, and the average, max, and min of the changes in profit/loss.The results are printing to the terminal and to a text file.

## PyPoll
This exercise was a bit more involved. We are still summarizing the elections and printing those results out, but we need to employ various stategies to account for an unknown number of candidates. We're using a dictionary in this set to store lists of the candidates, the vote count, and the percent of vote value.
